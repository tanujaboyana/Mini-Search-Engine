# 🔍 Mini Search Engine using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity

A **Python-based mini search engine** that retrieves and ranks text documents based on user queries using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**, demonstrating core principles of **information retrieval and machine learning**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Search engines form the backbone of modern information systems.  
This project simulates a **simplified document search engine** by transforming text into numerical vectors and ranking documents based on semantic relevance.

> 📌 This project showcases practical understanding of **text processing, vector space models, and similarity-based ranking**.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📄 Automatically reads multiple text documents
- 🔎 Accepts real-time user search queries
- 📊 Converts text into TF-IDF feature vectors
- 📐 Computes cosine similarity between query and documents
- 🏆 Ranks documents based on relevance score
- ⚠️ Handles no-match queries gracefully

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Documents are vectorized using **TF-IDF**
2. User query is transformed using the same vectorizer
3. **Cosine similarity** is computed between query and documents
4. Documents are ranked in descending order of similarity
5. Top matching documents are displayed with scores
